# ciceksepeti-frontend
ciceksepeti frontend assignment project

* I did not want use any other prepared template projects like create-react-app to show my project build abilities (webpack etc.)
so I decided to build the project from scratch.

* I have pretty much experience with class components or old redux library usages with helper libraries such as immutable.js etc. but I preferred
current popular stacks to build.

* The Project contains redux-toolkit library for state managment and redux-saga middleware for tasks like sideEffect managment.
Although the project was too small for redux-saga implementation I wanted to bring tiny service request example. In order to do that I created small
product service with node.js and published it. https://ciceksepeti-backend.vercel.app/api/products https://github.com/kaanbayram/ciceksepeti-backend

* I splitted all file types to diffrent folders to created better dist folder. (copyPluginPatterns etc.)

* In order to reminiscence real time projects added localization helper class to make project multilanguage.

* Also I splitted project to diffrent modules to create better import experience from diffrent projet boundries.

* Used the page size constants from specific scss file. (didn't need much so there aren't many examples)

* Created three different webpack files to make more observable project root.

* Project deployed to Vercel.
